Suppose you have an ensemble reanalysis, like `20CR <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean/>`_. So you have 56 different estimates of the global mean-sea-level pressure field at a particular date (say, 1903-10-27:18). There is quite a lot of spread in this ensemble, the pressures are uncertain.

But we've also found a previously-unused observation, a measurement of MSLP at that time a a weather station (say in Fort William). We can use that new observation to improve the reanalysis estimate, with the `Ensemble Kalman Filter <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean/>`_ or something similar.

This module does this. It takes reanalysis data and observations, and assimilates the observations into the reanalysis fields, making improved versions.

    new_field=DIYA.constrain_cube(old_field,old_field,obs)
