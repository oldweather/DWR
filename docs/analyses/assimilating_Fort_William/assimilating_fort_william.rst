This illustrates the effect of assimilating a single new station. Note that only the observation at the time of the plot is assimilated - information from earlier and later observations should also be used, which would increase the effect. Also, however, the observation uncertainty used in the this asimilation is unrealistically small (0.1hPa), which may compensate somewhat.
