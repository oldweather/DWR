# Use the new observations digitised from the Daily Weather Reports

The WeatherRescue project ([weatherrescue.org](http://weatherrescue.org), led by Ed Hawkins) is working to transcribe UK and European historical weather observations from the UK Daily Weather Reports ([DWR](https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/archive/sdb%3Acollection|86058de1-8d55-4bc5-8305-5698d0bd7e13/). Initially, they are recovering data from the start of the twentieth century. Rescuing these observations will enormously increase the weather and climate information available to science, for this region, for the period rescued.

The rescued observations will eventually be used in the major reconstructions of weather and climate: By the [Met Office National Climate Information Centre](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate), the [Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR)](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/20thC_Rean/) and similar products. But this will take some time. This project aims to make a **fast** estimate of the improvements the new observations will bring, by making a statistical update to 20CR).
