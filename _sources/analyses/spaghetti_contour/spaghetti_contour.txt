Spaghetti-contour plots are a useful way to show both a weather variable (here mean-sea-level-pressure, MSLP) and the uncertainty in that field (the spread across an ensemble). In regions where the ensemble spread is small, the contours cluster together, in regions where the ensemble spread is large, the contours diverge.
