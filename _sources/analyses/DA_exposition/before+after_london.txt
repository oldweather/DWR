   MSLP at London, before and after assimilating the Fort William observation.

   Scatter plots of 20CR2c ensemble pressures at London at 6am on 22nd October 1903 against Fort William ensemble pressures. The London pressures are adjusted by fitting a linear regression (left plot) and then removing the fit from each value (right plot).
