Ideally the reanalysis ensemble pressures would cluster closely around the observed pressure at every DWR station. In practice the reanalysis is poorly constrained (no nearby observations assimilated) at some station locations and the ensemble can be widely spread, but even in such cases the observation should be within the range of the ensemble. This plot shows where the reanalysis is doing well, where it is well calibrated but has a large spread (where more observations should improve it a lot), and where it is badly calibrated (observation outside ensemble range). Of course the observations can be wrong too (ob. for Haparanda is wrong in this case).
