   On the left: MSLP Contours for 20CR v2c, observations assimilated (yellow circles), DWR observations not assimilated (larger circles, coloured by deviation from reanalysis: blue - observation lower, red - observation higher.
   On the right: MSLP observation (red line), and ensemble values (blue dots) at the location of each DWR station.
