   On the left: MSLP Contours for 20CR v2c, observations assimilated (yellow circles), DWR observations not assimilated (larger circles, coloured by deviation from reanalysis: blue - observation lower, red - observation higher.

   Top right: Scatter plot of ensemble-observation against observation at each DWR station.

   Bottom right: Scatter plot of ensemble standard deviation against ensemble-mean - observation.
