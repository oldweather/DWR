The Daily Weather Reports
=========================

.. pull-quote::

    "It has been desired that a great many observations should be compared throughout the British Islands (with their neighbouring coasts and seas), at certain remarkable periods, to obtain the means of deliniating or mapping the atmosphere at successive times; and thence to deduce the order of those changes of wind and weather which affect navigation and fisheries especially, besides agriculture, health, and all out-door occupations.

    Such maps or charts should show the various horizontal or other currents of wind (existing within such an area) at one time, to which all other corresponding times should be reduced by allowing for the *difference of longitude*.

    They should show the pressure and temperature of those currents - and other facts, such as the presence of clouds, rain, lightning &c., at their respective localities.

    A sequence of such maps, compiled for special periods when changes have been most marked, would enable meteorologists to trace atmospheric waves as well as currents, both in plan and section, and would throw much light on meteorology."

   --Robert Fitzroy - `The weather book, a Manual of Practical Meteorology <https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&output=text&id=J4GDgpKKXCkC>`_ (1863)

To meet this need,, Fitzroy created the `Daily Weather Reports <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/library/archive-hidden-treasures/daily-weather-reports>`_ (DWR). Starting on 3rd September 1860, and running up to the present day, these contain synoptic observations from weather stations in and around the British Isles, sent to the Met Office by telegraph. The stations included, and frequency of observations, vary through the period of the reports, but in the early 1900s (the period covered here), they contain data from about 50 stations, reported twice daily.

The reports are on paper, and to use them in science we need them as a digitised database. The `National Meteorological Library and Archive <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/library>`_ have made `digital images of the DWR series <https://digital.nmla.metoffice.gov.uk/archive/sdb%3Acollection|86058de1-8d55-4bc5-8305-5698d0bd7e13/>`_, and the citizen science project `weatherrescue.org <https://weatherrescue.org>`_ is in the process of transcribing them.
