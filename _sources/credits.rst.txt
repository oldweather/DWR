* This document was written by Philip Brohan (`Met Office <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research>`_). He was funded by the Joint DECC and Defra Integrated Climate Programme, DECC/Defra (GA01101).
* The 1900-1910 DWR observations came from the many contributors to the `Weather Rescue citizen science project <http://weatherrescue.org>`_, led by `Ed Hawkins <http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/home/index.php>`_, supported by `NERC <https://nerc.ukri.org/>`_, `NCAS <https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/>`_, and the `University of Reading <http://www.reading.ac.uk/>`_.
* The 1899-1904 Ben Nevis and Fort William observations came from the many contributors to the `Weather Rescue Ben Nevis citizen science project <https://weatherrescue.wordpress.com/2017/09/05/weathermen-of-ben-nevis>`_, led by `Ed Hawkins <http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/home/index.php>`_, supported by `NERC <https://nerc.ukri.org/>`_, `NCAS <https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/>`_, and the `University of Reading <http://www.reading.ac.uk/>`_. 
* The two 'Weather Rescue' projects used the `Zooniverse.org <https://zooniverse.org>`_ platform, development of which is funded by generous support, including a `Global Impact Award from Google <https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/giving/impact-awards.html>`_, and by a grant from the `Alfred P. Sloan Foundation <https://sloan.org/>`_.
* The 1875-1899 Scilly observations were provided by `Ed. Hanna (University of Lincoln) <http://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/ehanna>`_.
* The 1920-1960 DWR observations came from a `storm variability project <https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/fluctuations-in-autumnwinter-severe-storms-over-the-british-isles-1920-to-present(7135f643-9419-4e6a-b2e9-91bd137e13be).html>`_ led by Rob Allan and Lisa Alexander (`Met Office <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research>`_).
* The 1856-1881 DWR and French DWR observations came from work done as part of `The EMULATE project <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/emslp/>`_.
* This is part of a larger program of work on historical climate data coordinated by the `International ACRE Program <http://www.met-acre.net>`_.
* This dataset is possible only because of the insight of `Robert Fitzroy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_FitzRoy>`_ in setting up the observing network and data collection system, and the effort of many people and institutions in making, sharing, and preserving the observations.
